# Boss-Bot
A bot for discord, the VoIP service.

This is just a small discord bot that i've been working on since around June 2020.
Unfortunetly i've lost about 2 months worth of commit history (from june to august) because of an accident I had while trying to push a new version out. 

This project was originally written in Java however after discovering Kotlin and trying it out, I liked it much more and decided to make switch the bot's langauge over to Kotlin.
The purpose of this project was for me to pracise my programming, get familiar with some java libraries and generally just learn how to code in java (this is my first project with java / kotlin!)

The bot is currently being hosted and can be invited using the link below, however there may still be issues with it and i am still working on it!

Thank you for reading
